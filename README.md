obfuscatedformfield
===================

Obfuscates the value of a hidden form field in order to prevent automated scripts from reading that value.

Please note:
This is just very simple obfuscation, not a method of adding security.
The value is restored client side, so every advanced user can repeat the restoration process manually.
